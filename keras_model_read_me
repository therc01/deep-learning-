## Keras DL model readme

I have used Keras API for building two types of simple neural networks.
First network contains 1 hidden layer with 10 nodes and i have used it thrice, once with 50 epoch and unnormalised input.

Second time i have used normalised data input and lastly had used 100 epochs.
 2nd model consisted of 3 hidden layers with 10 nodes each and a dense layer without any activation for output.
